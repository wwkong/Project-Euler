-- How up-right routes are there through a 20x20 grid?

-- This is more of a combinatorics problem than a programming one (20x20 grid has 40 C 20 combinations)

-- Create a nCm function
choose :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
choose _ 0 = 1
choose n k = choose (n-1) (k-1) * n `div` k

-- Print and write out the answer
main :: IO()
main = do
        let ans = choose 40 20
        writeFile "pe15.txt" $ show ans
        print ans
