-- Find the next (from the first) triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

{-
It can be shown with some arithmetic and manipulation of the quadratic equation, that a number N is Pentagonal
if 1+24*N is a perfect square and (sqrt(1+24*N) + 1) `mod` 6 == 0. Similarly, N is Hexagonal if 1+8*N is a perfect
square and (sqrt(1+8*N) + 1) `mod` 4 == 0. We also know from a previous problem that N is a triangle number when
1+8*N is a perfect square and (sqrt(1+8*N) + 1) `mod` 2 == 0.
